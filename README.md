#RoomPathY
Roompathy is an intelligent environment that adapts itself following your personal emotions. 

Imagine a room that collects your physical information, such as heartbeat and GSR, and creates your psychological profile asking some simple question through a companion application. Then it modifies the environment around you with lights adjustment and soundscape creation. 

So if you got angry, the system will try to turn itself into an happier and relaxing environment. Furthermore, during and after each session you can interact with the application and give some feedback in order to improve the next ones. 

Roompathy may be naturally useful to anyone already in therapy for emotive issues or anxiety as an additional helping factor, but we also recommend it as a way to just improve your living at home by setting it up in a specific room inside your house. 

As a secondary target, a multiple-people implementation may be possible in the future.
